# Structure
## Aim
To create a structure to store students data.
## Theory
Structure is a user defined data type in C which allows us to store variables of multiple data types, unlike arrays which allow us to store only one data type. Basically, a structure creates a data type that can be used to group items of possibly different types into a single type. Structures are widely used to represent a record. In this program, we have constructed a structure for a student database in college which includes, name, division and the roll number of the student. For this program, we have taken the maximum size of the structure to be 4, i.e, it can take only upto 4 entries for the database. To define a structure, we use the keyword "struct". 
## Algorithm
Step 1:Define a structure sit and initialize name, div and prn as variables inside the structure. 
Step 2:Initialize a structure "a" of the data type strcut sit. 
Step 3:Take input for the student details needed. 
Step 4:Print the details by calling it from the structure by "a[i].detail". 
Step 5:End. 
## Conclusion
In this practical, we learnt about structres. We learnt how to initialize a structure, how to store values in the structure variables and how to call back the structure while printing the output.
